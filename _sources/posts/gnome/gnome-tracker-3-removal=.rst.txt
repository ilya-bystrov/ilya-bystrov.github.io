########################
Gnome Tracker 3: Removal
########################

Idea
====

It's not possible to remove or purge "tracker" packages because Gnome is dependent on them.
However, the "tracker" packages can be easily replaced by fake empty packages.

Tracker Overview 
================

From https://tracker.gnome.org/overview/

  It’s not designed to be used directly by desktop users, but it provides a commandline tool named tracker3 for the adventurous.

  ...

  Tracker allows your application to instantly perform full-text searches across all documents. This feature is used by
  the ‘search’ bar in GNOME Files, for example.

  ...

  Tracker 3 is divided into two subprojects:

  * Tracker SPARQL, a lightweight database library built around SQLite.

  * Tracker Miners, a set of daemons which crawl the filesystem and extract metadata from many types of file to provide a system-wide search service.

  ...

  Related projects

  * Xapian provides similar functionality to Tracker Miner FS. It focuses more on scalability and less on having a
    lightweight footprint. Unlike Tracker, it doesn’t support SPARQL or provide a Linked Data endpoint.

  * Baloo is a metadata and search framework by KDE, implemented using Xapian.

  * Recoll is a cross-platform desktop search application powered by Xapian.

  * Apache Lucene + Solr is a search engine which targets very large-scale workloads. It has a much heavier footprint compared to Tracker.

  * ripgrep-all is a commandline tool that can search for text within many types of file, and caches extracted data between runs.

  * See the Wikipedia article on Desktop search for more information.

Tracker Packages on Debian 12
=============================

The packages were discovered by running the command ``apt search 'metadata database, indexer and search tool'`` and
through the autocompete of ``apt show tracker<TAB>``.

List of packages:


* libtracker-doc

* libtracker-sparql-3.0-0

* libtracker-sparql-3.0-dev

* tracker

* tracker-extract

* tracker-miner-fs

* tracker-test-utils

4 of them were installed.


* libtracker-sparql-3.0-0

* tracker

* tracker-extract

* tracker-miner-fs

3 of them need to be replaced.


* tracker

* tracker-extract

* tracker-miner-fs

Packages replacement
====================

The procedure should be repeated for all 3 packages.

.. code:: bash

  $ dpkg -L tracker-miner-fs > tracker-miner-fs-files
  $ apt show tracker-miner-fs > tracker-miner-fs
  $ equivs-build tracker-miner-fs
  $ sudo dpkg -i tracker-miner-fs_3.4.3-1_all.deb
  $ # check the deletion of files in tracker-miner-fs-files
  $ # delete manually if needed
  $ # commands to check: 1. tac tracker-miner-fs-files | xargs file {}
  $ #                    2. tac tracker-miner-fs-files | xargs file {} | grep -i 'text\|data'

I only had to manually delete one file in my case: ``/etc/xdg/autostart/tracker-miner-fs-3.desktop``.

Put newly installed packages on hold.

.. code:: bash

  $ sudo apt-mark hold tracker tracker-extract tracker-miner-fs

Note: libtracker-sparql-3.0-0
-----------------------------

Replacement of ``libtracker-sparql-3.0-0`` breaks ``nautilus``:

.. code:: bash

  $ nautilus 
  nautilus: error while loading shared libraries: libtracker-sparql-3.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Remove dirs
===========


* ``~/.local/share/tracker``

* ``~/.cache/tracker``

* ``~/.cache/tracker3``


Conclusion
==========

While it may not be possible to completely remove or purge the "tracker" packages due to Gnome's dependency on them,
they can be replaced with fake empty packages to effectively disable their functionality.
