Writing a Resume Key Points
===========================

LinkedIn learning have a nice course: `Writing a Resume with Stacey Gordon <https://www.linkedin.com/learning/writing-a-resume>`_.

Here is my key points.


* Experience section

  + On the top (Education first if Early Career)

  + Subsections

    - Company name

    - Location

    - Job title 

      * Most recent

    - Dates of employment

    - Duties and responsibilities

      * At least 3

      * 5 should be fine

      * First 2 or 3 should contain the most important information

        + Later bullets may not be read, at least no initially

      * Check job description for bullet points

        + Search using the company name and the job title

        + Similar jobs

  + Use numbers when you can

  + Demonstrate stability, longevity, leadership qualities


* Summary of Qualifications and Objectives should be `customized <https://www.linkedin.com/learning/writing-a-resume/use-your-objective-to-focus-the-reader>`_
  for vacancies

  + Summary of Qualifications = What makes you stand out?

  + Professional Summary


* Achievements

  + Placement

    - In the end or in the beginning for every work experience

    - Or in Summary of Qualifications

    - Or in own section Achievements

  + Take into account relevance and scale before making decision 


* Award

  + Space, relevance, non-negative impression


* Presentations and publications

  + Number of views

  + Value


* Education at the bottom (because of work experience)

  + No need to include graduation dates if out of the school for several years

  + Specify education equivalent if needed (for instance, Master's degree in CS)


* Membership and Affiliations

  + Industry-based

    - Search and join


* Name and location

  + Email address, phone number

    - Voicemail should work

      * Check it

    - SMS
