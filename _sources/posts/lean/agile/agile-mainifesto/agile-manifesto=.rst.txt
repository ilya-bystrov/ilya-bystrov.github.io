Agile Manifesto: Pitfalls in Terminology When Referring to the Manifesto
========================================================================

Well-known Agile Manifesto consists of `4 statements <https://agilemanifesto.org>`_
and `12 principles behind the manifesto <https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html>`_.

Clear understanding of terminology is essential in effective communication.
From my point of view, there are common *pitfalls in terminology* when referring to the manifesto:


* There are *no values* in the manifesto.

  + The manifesto declares that in each of the 4 statements *items* on the left *are valued* more than items 
    on the right, that's it.

* Principles are *not based* on the manifesto, it's the opposite.

  + The manifesto clearly states that *principles behind the manifesto*.

    - It means that **inductive reasonig** was used: 12 principles were generalized in 4 statements.

As a result, manifesto statements are aligned with principles.

My compound view of statements and principles 
----------------------------------------------

Keep in mind that statements arose from principles, not the other way round.


* **Individuals and interactions** over *processes and tools*

  + \(5) Build projects around **motivated individuals**. Give them the environment and support they need, and 
    trust them to get the job done.

  + \(6) The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is 
    **face-to-face conversation**.

  + \(11) The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing teams**.

    - \(12) At regular intervals, the **team reflects** on how to become more effective, then tunes and 
      adjusts its behavior accordingly.

|


* **Working software** over *comprehensive documentation*

  + \(1) Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous **delivery of valuable 
    software**.

    - \(3) **Deliver working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
      preference to the shorter timescale.

  + \(7) Working software is **the primary measure of progress**.

|


* **Customer collaboration** over *contract negotiation*

  + \(4) Business people and developers must **work together daily** throughout the project.

|


* **Responding to change** over *following a plan*

  + \(2) **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the 
    customer's competitive advantage.

|


* Not directly associated 

  + \(8) Agile processes promote sustainable development.  The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
    to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

  + \(9) Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

  + \(10) Simplicity -- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done -- is essential.
